# Project: Data Lake for Sparkify 
Sparkify is a music streaming startup that has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.
In this project we will build ETL pipeline that read their data from S3, proccess them iusing Spark, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. Finally, we will wright the data back on S3.  
## Project Datasets: 
There are two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

`Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data
Log data json path: s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json`

### 1.Song Data :
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

`song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

`{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}`

### 2.Log Data:
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

## Project Steps:
In this project we will use Amazon Web Services. The project will go through the following steps :
1. Configure the connection to spark. And prepare the Accsess Key Info.
2. Create Spark session so we can proccess our data on spark.
3. Load the data from S3. 
4. Process the song Data.
5. Process the log Data.

### Designed Database Schema:
Using the song and event datasets, we will create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

#### 1.Fact Table :
1. songplays - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong : songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

#### 2.Dimension Tables :
1. users - users in the app : user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
2. songs - songs in music database : song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
3. artists - artists in music database : artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude
4. time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units : start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday
## How to run the project:
Type the  below command  in the terminal and then press Enter:
`python3 etl.py`
